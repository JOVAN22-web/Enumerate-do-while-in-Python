# Enumerate-do-while-in-Python


We have do while loops in C,C++,Java but we don't have do while loops in python. We can emulate it though.

Condition:
Use an infinite while loop with a break statement wrapped in an if statement.
The if statement checks a given condition and breaks the iteration if it is true.
